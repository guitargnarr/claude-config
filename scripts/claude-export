# AI-Native Development - Teaching Guide

**How to Build at Scale Through AI Orchestration**

---

## What is AI-Native Development?

**Traditional development**: Human writes code manually
**AI-assisted development**: Human writes code with AI helping
**AI-native development**: Human orchestrates AI to build systems

**This guide teaches the third category.**

---

## Prerequisites

- Access to Claude Code (or similar AI development tool)
- Basic understanding of software concepts
- Willingness to verify everything (never trust blindly)
- Git and terminal familiarity

---

## The Parallel Development Method

### Core Pattern

1. **Identify 2-4 independent tasks** (no dependencies)
2. **Create git worktrees** (isolated workspaces)
3. **Open 4 terminal windows** (one per feature)
4. **Write clear specifications** (what to build, how to verify)
5. **Let AI execute autonomously** (don't micromanage)
6. **Verify quality through testing** (automated gates)
7. **Merge when verified** (all checks pass)

### Why It Works

- Forces modular architecture (can't edit same files in parallel)
- Human orchestrates, doesn't implement
- Quality gates catch errors automatically
- Scales linearly (4 instances = 4x throughput)

---

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Setup (5 minutes)

\`\`\`bash
# 1. Create feature branches with worktrees
cd ~/Projects/your-project
git worktree add ~/.worktrees/your-project/feature-a -b feature-a
git worktree add ~/.worktrees/your-project/feature-b -b feature-b

# 2. Open 2 terminals
# Terminal 1: cd ~/.worktrees/your-project/feature-a
# Terminal 2: cd ~/.worktrees/your-project/feature-b

# 3. Start Claude Code in each
# In both terminals: claude
\`\`\`

### Specification Template

\`\`\`
Build [feature name].

Requirements:
- [Specific requirement 1]
- [Specific requirement 2]

Constraints:
- Only modify files in [directory]
- Must pass tests
- Must build successfully

Acceptance:
- Feature works as described
- Tests pass
- Build succeeds

After completion:
1. Run tests
2. Create commit
3. Push branch
4. Create PR

Proceed autonomously.
\`\`\`

### Execution (30-60 minutes)

- AI instances work independently
- You monitor every 15 minutes
- Redirect if needed
- Don't interrupt working sessions

### Verification (10 minutes)

\`\`\`bash
# Check PRs created
gh pr list

# Test builds
git checkout feature-a && npm run build
git checkout feature-b && npm run build

# Check for conflicts
git diff --cached | grep -E "^(\+.*<<<<<<)"
\`\`\`

### Merge (5 minutes)

\`\`\`bash
# If all checks pass
gh pr merge [PR-number] --squash
\`\`\`

---

## Success Factors

1. **Clear specifications**: AI needs explicit requirements
2. **Independent tasks**: No overlapping file edits
3. **Autonomous execution**: Don't wait for confirmation
4. **Quality gates**: Tests must pass before merge
5. **Verification**: Always test, never trust

---

## Common Mistakes

- ❌ Dependent tasks (A needs B to finish first)
- ❌ Same file edits (causes merge conflicts)
- ❌ Vague specifications ("make it better")
- ❌ No testing (quality not verified)
- ❌ Micromanaging (interrupting AI mid-work)

---

## Resources

For complete methodology documentation:
- Parallel Development Playbook (v4.0)
- Collaboration Contract (how to work with AI)
- Trust Protocol (verification methods)
- Foundations (philosophy and values)

---

## Next Steps

1. Try with 2 simple features first
2. Verify everything works
3. Scale to 4 features when comfortable
4. Document what you learn
5. Teach others

**The future of development is orchestration, not implementation.**
