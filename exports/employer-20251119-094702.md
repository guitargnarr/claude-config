## Executive Summary

I orchestrate AI to build production systems at 2-4x traditional development speed while maintaining professional quality standards. My parallel development methodology (v4) has achieved 100% success rate across 12 production deployments.

**Key differentiator**: I've proven that AI-native development produces professional-quality results faster than traditional methods, with full test coverage and automated quality gates.
