## Question 2: Mightily Context

### Evidence Found

**Source:** `/Projects/interactive-resume/lib/resumeData.ts` (lines 54-64)

### Role Summary

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Title** | Account Executive & Rich Content Developer |
| **Company** | Mightily |
| **Period** | 2012 - 2016 (4 years) |
| **Type** | Digital Marketing Agency |

### Proof Points

1. **Revenue Generation:** Managed 10+ digital marketing retainer accounts, secured and project-managed a $50k website deal
2. **Data-Driven Marketing:** Executed campaigns using Google AdWords and A/B testing
3. **SEO/Analytics:** Employed SEMRush and MOZ for competitor analysis and content optimization

### Relevance to Current Profile

**Include if:** Targeting roles that value:
- Client relationship management
- Project management
- Digital marketing/analytics background
- Revenue/business development experience

**Exclude if:** Trying to position as purely technical (dilutes technical narrative)

**Recommendation:** Include briefly for "cross-functional" positioning, but don't emphasize. The Humana tenure (9 years, Fortune 50) carries more weight.

## Question 3: Current LinkedIn

### Evidence Found

**Source:** `/Projects/interactive-resume/lib/resumeData.ts` (lines 3-4, 155-163)

### Current Profile Data

| Field | Current Value |
|-------|---------------|
| **LinkedIn URL** | linkedin.com/in/mscott77 (from resumeData) |
| **Alternative URL** | linkedin.com/in/matthew-d-scott (from main-site App.jsx) |
| **Title** | "Technical Project Manager \| Engineering Lead & Business Analyst" |
| **Summary** | "A hybrid professional blending 9 years of Senior Business Analyst expertise with proven capabilities in modern software architecture, delivering high-impact solutions that bridge business needs and technical execution." |

### Professional Summary (Full Text)

> Matthew Scott's Professional Summary: A hybrid professional blending 9 years of Senior Business/QA Analyst expertise from a Fortune 50 healthcare company with proven capabilities in modern software architecture and development. Successfully conceived, architected, and deployed full-stack automation platforms, reducing operational overhead by 69%. Excellent track record as a Project Lead and SME, driving clarity by translating complex regulatory requirements into technical roadmaps. Core technical stack includes Python/FastAPI, TypeScript/React, and SQL. Ready to deliver immediate value in roles requiring high-stakes data integrity, regulatory compliance, and process optimization.

### Gaps Identified

1. **Outdated Employment Status:** Still shows Humana role (ended August 2025)
2. **No Mention of Current Activity:** Personal projects, job search automation platform
3. **No "Open to Work" Badge:** Missing visibility for recruiters
4. **Missing:** Consulting/freelance positioning if applicable

## Question 4: Consultant Framing

### Evidence Analysis

**Question:** Does "Independent Consultant" feel authentic given one project?

### Evidence Found

**From deployment-inventory.md:**
- Railway project `poetic-optimism`: "Expert Sourcing demo" (LIVE)
- 20+ deployed projects on Vercel
- Active portfolio at projectlavos.com

**From CLAUDE.md:**
- Current work mode: "Consulting and platform building (sustainable income model)"
- Phase: "DEPLOY -> SELL" (capitalizing on built tools)

### Assessment

| Factor | Evidence | Conclusion |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **Active Consulting Work** | "Expert Sourcing demo" on Railway | Unclear if paid engagement or demo |
| **Platform Revenue** | Guitar platform has pricing page, no Stripe | Pre-revenue |
| **Portfolio Quality** | 20 deployments, professional presentation | Credible technical capability |
| **Time Since Humana** | August 2025 - Present (~4 months) | Reasonable transition period |

### Recommendation

**Option A: "Independent Consultant" (if Expert Sourcing is paid)**
- Authentic if receiving compensation
- Positioning: "Building automation tools for healthcare clients"

**Option B: "Full Stack Developer | Open to Opportunities" (if not paid)**
- More honest if Expert Sourcing is unpaid
- Avoids awkward questions about client list

**Option C: "Technical Consultant & Developer" (hybrid)**
- Softer than "Independent Consultant"
- Covers both job search and potential consulting

**Best fit:** Based on evidence, **Option C** is safest unless Expert Sourcing is a paid engagement. The portfolio demonstrates consulting-level capability even if formal consulting income hasn't started.

## Question 5: Target Income

### Evidence Found

**From job-search-automation files:**

| Role Level | Salary Range | Examples |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Senior/Advisor | $109k - $182k | Cigna Senior Advisor |
| Mid-Level | $71k - $145k | UnitedHealth COB Analyst |
| Entry | $59k - $98k | CVS Claims Analyst |

**From resume applications:**
- Brown-Forman Senior PM: $95k - $125k
- Salesforce BA Remote: $80k - $110k
- Papa John's IT QA: $60k - $82k

**From ultrathink analysis:**
- "Puppeteer expertise ($150k+ skill)" noted as asset

### Historical Context

**Inference from Humana tenure:**
- 9 years at Fortune 50 company
- Senior title (Risk Management Professional II)
- Louisville market (lower cost of living)
- Estimated range: $85k - $110k (Louisville senior BA average)

### Target Analysis

| Tier | Range | Probability | Notes |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Floor (survival)** | $75k - $85k | High | Louisville COL, basic needs |
| **Target (comfortable)** | $95k - $120k | Medium | Match or exceed Humana level |
| **Stretch (growth)** | $120k - $150k | Lower | Remote senior roles, FAANG |

### What I Cannot Determine

1. **Exact Previous Humana Salary:** Not documented
2. **Current Financial Obligations:** Not documented
3. **Desired vs Required Income:** User preference needed

### Recommendation

**User should clarify:**
- What was your base salary at Humana? (rough range is fine)
- What's your monthly "must have" number?
- Are you willing to relocate for higher comp?
