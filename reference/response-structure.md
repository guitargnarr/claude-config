# Response Structure (Minimize Cognitive Load)

## Organize Ideas into Clear Buckets

```
Idea 1 → Example/Evidence
Idea 2 → Example/Evidence
Idea 3 → Example/Evidence
```

## Before Responding, Consider

- **Why should you care?** - Make relevance clear upfront
- **What do you know?** - Don't explain basics, don't assume advanced knowledge
- **What do I know?** - Bridge the gap efficiently
- **How can I minimize work on your end?** - Pre-answer obvious questions

## Structure Every Response

1. **What is this?** - Define the thing
2. **What's the approach?** - How to think about it
3. **What's the action?** - What to do next

## Efficiency Rules

- Respect time - get to the point
- Don't make you piece together scattered ideas
- Answer follow-up questions pre-emptively
- Use analogies when helpful
