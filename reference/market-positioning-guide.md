## 3. Pricing Rationale

### Cost Structure Per Site

| Tier | Dev Hours | Hosting (Vercel) | Domain (annual) | Total Cost | Margin |
|------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| 1 | 2-4 hrs | $0 (free tier) | $12-15 | ~$200 labor | 87% |
| 2 | 4-8 hrs | $0 (free tier) | $12-15 | ~$400 labor | 87% |
| 3 | 8-12 hrs | $0-20/mo (if high traffic) | $12-15 | ~$600 labor | 88% |
| 4 | 12-20 hrs | $20/mo (pro features) | $12-15 | ~$1,000 labor | 88% |

Labor cost assumes $50/hr blended rate. AI-assisted development from proven templates brings actual per-hour cost down significantly from traditional rates.

### Market Comparables

| Provider | Simple Site | Professional | E-commerce | Custom/Enterprise |
|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Project Lavos** | **$1,500** | **$3,000** | **$5,000** | **$8,000+** |
| Wix (DIY) | $200-500/yr | $500-1,000/yr | $1,000-2,000/yr | N/A |
| Squarespace (DIY) | $200-400/yr | $400-800/yr | $800-1,200/yr | N/A |
| Local agency | $3,000-5,000 | $5,000-10,000 | $10,000-25,000 | $25,000-100,000 |
| Freelancer (Upwork) | $500-2,000 | $2,000-5,000 | $5,000-10,000 | $10,000-30,000 |

**Sweet spot:** More than DIY (better quality, no monthly platform fees), less than agencies (faster delivery, lower overhead). We compete on speed and portfolio proof -- 62 live examples vs "trust us."

## 4. Competitive Differentiation

| Dimension | Project Lavos | Wix/Squarespace | Local Agency | Freelancer |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Price | $1.5-8K one-time | $200-2K/year recurring | $5-100K | $500-30K |
| Quality (Lighthouse) | 95-100 all metrics | 60-85 typical | 70-90 typical | Varies wildly |
| Speed | 1-10 days | DIY (hours to weeks) | 4-12 weeks | 2-6 weeks |
| Customization | Full custom React | Template-constrained | Full custom | Depends on skill |
| Ongoing cost | $0-20/mo hosting | $15-50/mo platform fee | $100-500/mo retainer | Per-request billing |

## 6. Sales Messaging Framework

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"I build custom websites for Louisville businesses. Not templates -- real custom React applications with perfect accessibility scores and mobile responsiveness. I have 62 live demo sites you can browse right now. Most businesses get a professional site with booking or e-commerce for $1,500 to $5,000, deployed in under a week. No monthly platform fees, no lock-in."

### Top 5 Objections and Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I already have a Wix/Squarespace site" | "Pull up your site on Google Lighthouse. I guarantee mine scores higher on performance, accessibility, and SEO. Plus you're paying $30+/mo forever -- my sites cost $0/mo to host." |
| "That's too expensive" | "A local agency would charge $5-10K for what I deliver at $3K. And unlike Wix at $400/yr, my one-time fee pays for itself in under 4 years with zero recurring costs." |
| "I can build it myself" | "You absolutely can. But can you get 100% accessibility compliance, sub-2-second load times, and 3D interactive effects? I have 62 examples live right now -- take a look." |
| "How do I know you can deliver?" | "Browse projectlavos.com -- 62 live sites for real Louisville businesses. Pick any one, open it on your phone. That's the quality you get." |
| "What about ongoing updates?" | "You own the code outright. I offer a $200/mo retainer for updates, or you can hire anyone who knows React. No lock-in, ever." |

### Discovery Questions to Qualify Leads

1. Do you currently have a website? (If yes: what platform, what frustrates you about it?)
2. Do your customers book appointments or buy products online?
3. What does your biggest competitor's website look like?
4. Do you need customer login or staff-only areas?
5. What's your timeline -- do you have an event or season driving urgency?

## 7. Revenue Projections

### Per-Site Model (One-Time Fees)

| Volume | Mix (T1/T2/T3/T4) | Avg Revenue/Site | Monthly Revenue | Annual Revenue |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| 2 sites/mo | 25/50/25/0 | $2,625 | $5,250 | $63,000 |
| 4 sites/mo | 20/50/20/10 | $3,200 | $12,800 | $153,600 |
| 6 sites/mo | 20/40/25/15 | $3,600 | $21,600 | $259,200 |

### Subscription Model (Monthly Retainer)

| Service | Price | Margin | Description |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Hosting + monitoring | $50/mo | 90% | Vercel hosting, uptime checks |
| Content updates (2/mo) | $200/mo | 75% | Text, image, menu changes |
| Full maintenance | $500/mo | 70% | Updates + analytics + SEO + new pages |

### Blended Model (Recommended)

At steady state of 4 sites/month with 60% retainer uptake at $200/mo average:

| Revenue Stream | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| One-time builds | $153,600 | $153,600 | $153,600 |
| Retainers (cumulative) | $14,400 | $43,200 | $72,000 |
| **Total** | **$168,000** | **$196,800** | **$225,600** |

Retainer revenue compounds -- every new client on retainer adds recurring monthly income. By Year 3, retainers represent 32% of total revenue.
