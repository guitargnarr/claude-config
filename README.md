# Claude Code Configuration
**Modular configuration system for Matthew David Scott**

## Overview

This repository contains a modular, template-driven configuration system for Claude Code sessions. Created October 24, 2025 after breaking a 231-day analysis paralysis pattern.

## Key Lessons

**October 24, 2025 Pattern Break:**
- 231-day Python PATH issue fixed in 30 seconds
- Root cause: Analysis paralysis (665,280:1 ratio analysis:action)
- Solution: Requested "fix it" instead of "analyze it"
- Result: 3 portfolio APIs built in 22 minutes

**For Future Sessions:**
- Suggest fixes by request 3 (not request 13)
- "Execute" mode = autonomous decisions
- Measured action: Fast for unblocking, verified for career-critical

## Usage

Future Claude instances will read this configuration and apply lessons learned from 8 months of interaction.
