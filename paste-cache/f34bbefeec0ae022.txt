AboutAbout
As a Practice Management Consultant, I partner exclusively with healthcare providers to implement modern payment technology that supports a seamless, contactless experience. At Rectangle Health, we offer an end-to-end payment platform designed to streamline the revenue cycle, reduce administrative burden through integration, and enhance the overall patient experience.

Beyond my career in healthcare technology, my wife and I have had the privilege of growing within a private business development network that has transformed our lives — personally, professionally, and financially. It’s given us not only more freedom, but a deeper sense of purpose.

We're passionate about paying it forward — helping others build a life and business they’re excited about. Whether you're exploring ways to reclaim your time, grow additional income streams, or lead with purpose, I always enjoy connecting with like-minded professionals.

“Your influence is determined by how abundantly you place other people's interests first.”

Happy Birthday to my beautiful, amazing wife Leah N. King, M.Ed. 

I’m endlessly grateful for the woman who loves our three incredible children so selflessly, keeps our family grounded, and still shows up every day as an outstanding life and business partner. Watching you lead with grace, strength, and faith inspires me more than you know.

People often talk about career moves and business decisions, but the most important decision you’ll ever make in life is choosing the right partner. I’m thankful every day that I chose you.

Happy Birthday to the heartbeat of our family and the partner I get to build life with!

Met with my new manager yesterday and was sharing honestly about rebuilding my pipeline after the holiday break. The grind is real. In the middle of that conversation, he shared a quote that stuck with me:

“With Christ in the vessel, I can smile at the storm.”

It landed right where I needed it.

Today, that carried into my quiet time and morning reading. A few reminders hit home:

-Pressure is a privilege—it means you’re alive and still in the game.
-The strongest convictions are formed in the chrysalis called crisis.
-Long-suffering and setbacks don’t break us; they build capacity.

Growth isn’t comfortable, but comfort has never produced anything meaningful. And when Christ is in the vessel, even in the middle of the grind, the storm doesn’t get the final word.
