### [4] Portfolio CRM NOT Deployed
- **Location:** ~/Projects/client-sites/portfolio-crm/
- **Status:** Built, NOT deployed
- **LOC:** 2,199 lines
- **Planned:** Deploy to crm.projectlavos.com
- **Blocking:** Cannot track client outreach properly

### [5] Pricing Strategy NOT Implemented
**From ULTRATHINK_PRICING_STRATEGY.md:**

| Issue | Current | Recommended | Gap |
|-------|---------|-------------|-----|
| Tier 1 | $800 | $1,500 | Underpriced 47% |

| Tier 4 | $3,500 | $8,000 | Underpriced 56% |
| Cold email | $500 | REMOVE | 70% below market |

**Action:** Update pricing materials, remove $500 from outreach

### [6] CMS Strategy NOT Started
**From Phase 2 plan:**
- Sanity.io integration planned
- No work done
- Blocks recurring revenue ($50/mo add-on per client)

---

## PRIORITY 3: JOB SEARCH ISSUES (From ULTRATHINK_TRUTH_REPORT.md)

### [7] Email System BROKEN
- **100% bounce rate** on applications
- **0 responses** from 223+ days of searching
- Automation "decommissioned" but STILL RUNS
- `BCCEmailTracker.send_tracked_email()` is operational

### [8] Data Inconsistency
- 17 applications in DB
- 110+ emails sent
- Tracking systems NOT synchronized
- False positive filtering broken (139 emails filtered incorrectly)

### [9] Strategy Incoherence
- Claimed "human-centric pivot" but automation runs
- Internal transfer NOT explored (already at employer)
- No working email verification

---

## PRIORITY 4: AI TALENT OPTIMIZER (Roadmap Items)

### [10] v3.2.0 - AI Cover Letters (Pending)
- Ollama integration NOT started
- Was next milestone after resume customization

### [11] v3.3.0 - Deadline Tracking (Pending)
- Application deadlines NOT implemented

---

## PRIORITY 5: PORTFOLIO ISSUES (From ULTRATHINK_REALITY_CHECK.md)

### [12] iOS Launcher - Incomplete
**Status:** Exploratory, should be archived
- Only 15 of 40+ sites added
- Preview images load slowly (thum.io rate-limited)
- Generic icons, no real branding
- Separate from projectlavos.com (no integration)

**Recommendation:** Archive as portfolio piece, don't continue

### [13] projectlavos.com Crowding
**Problem:** 40+ projects displayed, overwhelming
**Solution NOT implemented:**
- Curated "Featured" section (5-10 best)
- Clear CTA for goal (hire me, contact)
- Industry categories

### [14] Pre-generated Screenshots Missing
- Still using thum.io (slow, rate-limited)
- Should pre-generate and store
- Affects both projectlavos.com and iOS launcher

---
