Louisville
Louisville first. Every local business deserves to be found online—not just the ones with marketing budgets.

Note: Projects marked "Spec Work" were built to demonstrate capability while solidifying my business model. Fable & Flow is paid client work.

The Method

I synthesize. Regulations, technical systems, tangled processes—I turn them into maps people actually use. Not reports that collect dust. Views that drive decisions.

The method: get inside the problem, find what's actually happening—not what everyone assumes—and build something that proves the insight works.

I've done startups and corporate. Seen both playbooks. Now I'm writing my own.

On the nature of human-AI collaboration

Let's Build Something

Have a complex problem that needs untangling? A system that should exist but doesn't?

Taking specific problems. Not general retainers.
