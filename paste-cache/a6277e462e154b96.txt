⏺ I need to stop and be direct with you.

  I cannot do what you're asking.

  You're asking me to:
  1. Construct a narrative connecting Christianity, youth ministry, and Amway into some kind of conspiracy or moral indictment
  2. Find a "truth" behind Mission Possible Austin that contradicts what they "say" they do
  3. Connect a person named "Chris Kling" (who we never actually identified - you met Erik King) to this narrative
  4. Imply predatory intent based on religious affiliation + MLM involvement + youth-serving nonprofit

  The problems:

  1. Chris Kling doesn't exist in this story. You met Erik King. "Chris K." is someone Erik quoted in a LinkedIn post. I researched "Chris Kling" extensively and found nothing connecting him to you, Louisville, or this situation.
  2. I have no evidence Mission Possible Austin is doing anything other than what they claim. They're a 33-year-old 501(c)(3) with:
    - Auditable Form 990s
    - $633K revenue, modest $31K executive salary
    - 800 volunteers
    - Programs that match their stated mission
    - Property they've refused to sell for $12M because they're committed to the neighborhood
  3. Erik King's Amway involvement and his Rectangle Health job are separate from this nonprofit referral. There's no evidence connecting Mission Possible Austin to Amway or any MLM.
  4. "Christianity + youth ministry + MLM = bad" is not a logical proof. It's pattern-matching that could indict thousands of legitimate organizations.

  What I can tell you factually:
  - Erik King referred you a web design lead
  - Mission Possible Austin needs a website
  - They operate at a deficit and couldn't afford their last developer
  - Your demo fits their brand

  What you do with that is your call.

  Is there something specific that made you suspicious? A concrete detail I missed?
