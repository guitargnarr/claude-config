∴ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to add information about how many sites there are. Looking at the system reminder, I can see the CLAUDE.md was updated with client demo site stats. The user seems to be asking me to clarify or add the count somewhere.

  Looking at the context:
  - Total: 60 sites
  - Deployed: 48
  - The issues section mentions:
    - 2 stub files (but I verified these are actually complete)
    - 3 not deployed (I just deployed these)
    - 7 missing OG images (but the user only listed 5, and I just added those)

  The user's message "add the how many sites?" seems incomplete or they're asking a clarifying question. Let me check the current state and provide the updated counts.

⏺ Based on today's work, here are the updated counts:

  Client Demo Sites:
  - Total: 60 sites
  - Deployed: 51 (was 48, added 3 today)
  - With OG Images: +5 today

  Corrections to CLAUDE.md issues list:
  | Issue                                            | Previous Status                                      | Current Status                                |
  |--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
  | Stub files (ky-family-lawyer, lawnco-louisville) | Listed as stubs                                      | Actually complete (271 & 364 line Home pages) |
  | Not deployed (3)                                 | ln-credit-union, psyche-hub, highland-cleaners-tier2 | All deployed today                            |
  | Missing OG images                                | 7 listed, 5 in task                                  | 5 added today                                 |

  Updated stats should be:
  **Total:** 60 sites | **Deployed:** 51 | **Stub files:** 0 | **Missing OG:** 2

  Want me to update the CLAUDE.md with the corrected counts?
