Ensures visitors to your deployments must enter a password in order to gain access.

This feature is available as part of Advanced Deployment Protection for an additional $150 per month.
Protection Bypass for Automation
Enable automation services to access protected deployments for this project. You can bypass Deployment Protection by sending an HTTP header or query parameter named 
x-vercel-protection-bypass
 with the bypass value. After the bypass is created, it is automatically available to all deployments as the system environment variable 
VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET
.

Add a secret that can be used to bypass Deployment Protection for this project.

Shareable Links
Shareable Links allow access to Protected Deployments for collaborators outside of your Vercel team.

These unique links can be created, revoked, and regenerated for any Deployment's 
up-to-date URL
 via the Share button on a Project's deployment page, or from the toolbar on a Preview Deployment, and will bypass Vercel Authentication, Password Protection, and Trusted IPs when these features are enabled.

OPTIONS Allowlist
Specify paths to be unprotected for OPTIONS requests. This can be used to enable CORS preflight requests to this project's protected deployments, as browsers do not send authentication on preflight requests. If an incoming request path starts with one of the specified paths, and has the method OPTIONS, the request will bypass deployment protection.

Deployment Protection Exceptions
Specify pre-production domains that you want to exclude from Deployment Protection.
Domains listed will become unprotected and publicly accessible.

This feature is available as part of Advanced Deployment Protection for an additional $150 per month.

Restrict access to deployments to visitors from specific IP addresses only. A maximum of 20 IP addresses can be added.
