# Complete Repository Audit Protocol

Execute a RIGOROUS, THOROUGH audit of repository: **$1**

## Required Methodology

### PRINCIPLES (Non-Negotiable):
1. ✅ ZERO shortcuts - read every file completely
2. ✅ Never simplify for convenience
3. ✅ Rigorous and honest reporting
4. ✅ No stone unturned
5. ✅ Quality over speed - NOT in a rush
6. ✅ ALL automation gets INTENSE scrutiny

### AUDIT CHECKLIST (Must Complete ALL):

#### Phase 1: Repository Discovery
- [ ] Locate repository on filesystem
- [ ] Verify git status and commits
- [ ] Count actual files (not estimated)
- [ ] Measure actual size
- [ ] List all directories

#### Phase 2: Python File Analysis
- [ ] Read EVERY Python file completely (no skipping)
- [ ] Count actual lines of code
- [ ] Identify main functionality
- [ ] Check for imports (Gmail API, SMTP, LinkedIn, etc.)
- [ ] Look for automation patterns

#### Phase 3: Documentation Review
- [ ] Read EVERY .md file completely
- [ ] Read EVERY .txt file completely
- [ ] Verify claims match reality
- [ ] Check for outdated information

#### Phase 4: Sensitive Data Scan
- [ ] Search for email addresses
- [ ] Search for passwords/credentials
- [ ] Search for personal information
- [ ] Search for employer references
- [ ] Search for previous GitHub accounts
- [ ] Check git history for exposed data

#### Phase 5: Automation Detection
- [ ] Gmail API usage?
- [ ] SMTP/email sending?
- [ ] LinkedIn automation?
- [ ] Job application automation?
- [ ] Bulk operations?
- [ ] Any external API calls?

#### Phase 6: Archive/Disabled Files
- [ ] Search for .DISABLED files
- [ ] Search for .bak files
- [ ] Search for backup/ directories
- [ ] Search for archive/ directories
- [ ] Check if restoration needed

#### Phase 7: GitHub Readiness Assessment
- [ ] Any blockers to publication?
- [ ] Sanitization required?
- [ ] What needs to be .gitignore'd?
- [ ] Safe to publish as-is?

#### Phase 8: Create Audit Report
- [ ] Create comprehensive .txt report in ~/Desktop/Github/
- [ ] Use format: {REPO}_COMPLETE_AUDIT_2025-10-13.txt
- [ ] Include ALL findings (no assumptions)
- [ ] Include file counts, LOC, metrics
- [ ] Include risk assessment
- [ ] Include GitHub readiness status
- [ ] Include recommendations

#### Phase 9: Update Coordination
- [ ] Update COORDINATION_STATUS.json
- [ ] Move repo from work_queue to completed_audits
- [ ] Set locked = false
- [ ] Update statistics

## Automation Risk Levels:

**CRITICAL**: Active automation that could cause professional harm
**HIGH**: Automation present but not active, contains sensitive data
**MEDIUM**: Automation framework/demos, needs review
**LOW**: Minimal automation concerns
**NONE**: No automation detected
