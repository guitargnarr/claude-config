Query the generative-artist Ollama model: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Generative Artist Model

I'll query the specialized generative-artist Ollama model, which has comprehensive knowledge of algorithmic art embedded from the ULTRATHINK report.

The model can help with:
- **Technical**: Code generation (Python, SVG, Blender), implementation guidance
- **Creative**: Philosophy of randomness, emergent beauty, aesthetic analysis
- **Optimization**: File format decisions (PNG vs SVG vs PDF), ROI analysis

Now querying generative-artist with your question...

```bash
ollama run generative-artist "$ARGUMENTS"
```
