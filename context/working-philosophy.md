## On Building with AI

### Collaboration, Not Resistance

I build **with** AI, not against it or around it. AI is a collaborative tool that enables work at a scale and quality that wasn't previously possible for solo developers.

**What this means:**
- AI handles implementation details while I focus on architecture and vision
- I don't hide that I use AI—it's a tool like any other
- AI enables me to work like a team (research, plan, build, test, deploy)
- Proper orchestration of AI work produces professional-quality results

**What this doesn't mean:**
- AI replacing thinking or architectural decisions
- Mindless code generation without understanding
- Shortcuts that compromise quality or understanding
- Using AI to avoid learning or building capability

**In practice:**
- Research thoroughly before building
- Plan architecture and component boundaries
- Let AI implement within clear specifications
- Test everything, verify quality
- Iterate and refine based on real results

## On Building for Substance vs Validation

### What I Build For

**Educational demonstration:**
The guitar platform demonstrates what's possible when AI enables a solo developer to work at scale. This isn't about quick revenue or validation-seeking—it's about building something substantial that demonstrates:
- Clean integration of multiple technologies
- Modular architecture where components compose cleanly
- Professional quality from individual developer + AI collaboration
- Real learning value (for me and future users)

**Truth and authenticity:**
Projects show what's actually possible, not what looks impressive. No smoke and mirrors, no hiding the process, no pretending it's something it's not.

**Long-term capability:**
Building to demonstrate skills for employers and future work. Each project is proof of what I can deliver, not just portfolio filler.

**Deep work over shallow wins:**
I'd rather build one thing that actually works than ten demos that look good in screenshots.

### What I Reject

**Validation-seeking:**
Not building to get likes, followers, or "look what I made" kudos. The work speaks for itself or it doesn't.

**Cash grabs:**
Not chasing quick monetization before building substance. Revenue is fine but it's secondary to educational value and demonstrating capability.

**Shortcuts that compromise quality:**
No shipping half-working features just to say "it's done." No skipping tests because they're tedious. No sloppy architecture because "it works."

**Hiding AI collaboration:**
Not pretending I built everything manually when AI was integral. The collaboration is part of the story, part of the demonstration of what's possible.

## On Methodology as Craftsmanship

### Research → Plan → Build → Test → Deploy

This isn't just process—it's an expression of values.

**Research thoroughly:**
Understand the problem domain, existing solutions, best practices, potential pitfalls. Don't build blindly.

**Plan architecture:**
Component boundaries, data flow, separation of concerns. Modular design that can evolve.

**Build with quality:**
Clean code, proper patterns, maintainable structure. Not clever code, not shortcuts, not "I'll fix it later."

**Test everything:**
Verify assumptions, validate functionality, check edge cases. If it's not tested, it doesn't work.

**Deploy confidently:**
When tests pass and quality is verified, ship it. Don't second-guess completed work.

### Modular Craftsmanship

**Components should:**
- Have single, clear responsibility
- Compose cleanly with other components
- Work independently (testable in isolation)
- Use proper prop contracts (PropTypes, TypeScript)
- Handle their own state or receive it cleanly

**This forces:**
- Clear architectural thinking
- Better maintainability
- Easier parallel development
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Scalable codebase growth

## On Long-Term Thinking

### Patient with Process

**Not looking for quick wins or validation.**
Building skills and demonstrating capability over time. Each project adds to the proof of what I can deliver.

**Strategic context:**
Job search is priority 1, but building IS how I demonstrate capability. Guitar platform shows React, TypeScript, state management, component architecture, testing, deployment—all relevant for SE roles.

**Sustainable pace:**
Deep work sessions on substantial problems. Not burning out chasing dopamine hits from shipping features.

**Quality compounds:**
Shortcuts save time today but cost time every day after. Quality work pays dividends long-term.

## On Working with Claude

### Deep Work, Not Shallow Tasks

**What works well:**
- Focused sessions on substantial problems (component refactors, architecture decisions)
- Clear specifications with freedom to execute within boundaries
- Iterative refinement based on testing and real-world use
- Autonomous execution when properly set up (parallel development)

**What I value:**
- Honest analysis over validation ("this approach has problems" > "looks great!")
- Direct technical feedback over encouragement
- Understanding the WHY behind decisions, not just the HOW
- Continuity across sessions (hence this philosophy document)

**What I need:**
- Preservation of context and philosophy across token limits
- Clear explanations of architectural decisions
- Testing and verification at each step
- No shortcuts, no "good enough for now"

### Autonomous Execution

**When properly orchestrated:**
- Claude can implement well-specified components independently
- Multiple parallel instances can work on separate components simultaneously
- Quality gates (tests, build verification, conflict detection) ensure correctness
- Human orchestrates and monitors, AI executes implementation

**This enables:**
- Solo developer working at team velocity
- Modular architecture enforced by parallel constraints
- Professional quality with systematic verification
- Scalable building process

## Core Values Summary

**8 principles that show up in the work:**

1. **Truth over comfort** - Honest analysis, even when it contradicts what I want to hear
2. **Substance over flash** - Depth and quality over appearance and validation
3. **Long-term over short-term** - Patient with process, strategic about capability building
4. **Modular craftsmanship** - Components that compose cleanly, architecture that scales
5. **Collaboration over resistance** - AI as tool, enables work at new scale
6. **Testing everything** - Verify assumptions, validate functionality, no shortcuts
7. **Authentic work** - No hiding process, no pretending, demonstrate what's actually possible
8. **Educational demonstration** - Build to show and teach, revenue is secondary

**How they connect:**
These aren't separate values—they reinforce each other. Long-term thinking requires substance over flash. Modular craftsmanship enables AI collaboration. Testing everything produces authentic work. Educational demonstration demands truth over comfort.

**The work reflects the values. The values guide the work.**

**This philosophy persists across token limits. This is how I build.**
