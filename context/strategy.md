# Strategy - Scale Validated Products

**Updated**: Nov 24, 2025 (MAJOR REVISION)
**Discovery**: You have 3 enterprise products with customer validation (not just tools)
**Strategic Pivot**: From "build products" to "scale validated products"

---

## The Reality (Post-Vetting Discovery)

**What we thought**: 40 repos to assess, find valuable ones, build products

**What actually exists**:
- **Mirador Systems**: Active business, Norton Healthcare pilot, $146K savings, LLC formed
- **job-search-automation**: Real traction (81 jobs, 14.3% response rate)
- **phishguard-ml**: Enterprise-grade (7-model ensemble, not just demo)

**These aren't "repos to vet."** These are **businesses to scale.**

---

## Revised Strategy: Focus on Validation

### Phase 1: Scale What's Proven (NOT Discover More)

**Mirador Systems** (Core Business):
- Customer: Norton Healthcare (pilot active)
- Validation: $146K annual savings (documented ROI)
- Product: Privacy-first AI orchestration (HIPAA-compliant)
- Next: Scale to more healthcare systems
- Revenue: $5K-50K/month per customer (enterprise SaaS)

**job-search-automation** (Real Traction):
- Users: You (81 jobs tracked successfully)
- Validation: 14.3% response rate (beats 5-8% baseline by 2x)
- Product: Job tracking + resume optimization + email automation
- Next: Deploy as SaaS, test $10-20/month pricing
- Revenue: $10K-50K/month at scale (13.8M unemployed TAM)

**phishguard-ml** (Enterprise Security):
- Validation: 100% test accuracy, 94-96% on real PhishTank emails
- Product: 7-model ensemble, 2,039 features, dual-mode API
- Next: Target enterprise security teams
- Revenue: $200-500/month per org, $5K-20K/year enterprise licensing

---

### Phase 2: Leverage Methodologies (NOT Build More Tools)

**We built**:
- Deployment Oracle (hybrid scoring)
- Elite Frontend Engineer (code generation)

**Don't**: Keep building tools, vetting 40 repos, deploying everything

**Do**: Use these tools to **improve the 3 validated products**:
- Oracle: Assess deployment complexity for scaling Mirador
- Elite Frontend: Generate admin dashboards for SaaS products
- Rapid deployment: Scale to multiple instances/customers

**Methodologies serve the products, not vice versa.**

---

### Phase 3: Monetize (NOT Document Revenue Strategy)

**We've documented** strategies, frameworks, vetting processes.

**We haven't**: Asked anyone to pay money.

**Next 30 days**:
1. **Mirador**: Pitch 3 more healthcare systems (Norton proves ROI)
2. **job-search-automation**: Deploy SaaS, test pricing, get first 10 paying users
3. **phishguard-ml**: Reach out to 5 CISOs, offer pilot (prove enterprise value)

**Success metric**: First revenue dollar (from validated product, not new tool)

---

## Oracle + Human Collaboration (Refined Role)

**Oracle's role** (unchanged):
- Filter deployment candidates
- Quick infrastructure assessment

**Human's role** (CHANGED):
- Focus on validated products (not discover new ones)
- Scale what works (Norton, job-search traction)
- Stop building, start selling

**Methodologies' role** (CHANGED):
- Support scaling validated products
- NOT: Build more products from 40 repos
- NOT: Vet everything before focusing

---

## Decision Framework (Updated)

**Old framework**: 3 questions (what problem, who pays, can methodologies help)

**New framework**: 1 question
- **Does this product have validation?** (customer, traction, ROI data)

**If YES**: Focus here (Mirador, job-search, phishguard)
**If NO**: Defer (portfolio pieces are fine, don't need monetization)

**Simple**: Validated products get 100% focus. Everything else is secondary.

---

## What Changed (Strategic Pivot)

**Before**: "Use methodologies to turn 40 repos into revenue"
**After**: "You have 3 validated products. Scale them."

**Before**: "Oracle + Human discover valuable repos"
**After**: "Focus on Norton success, job-search traction, phishguard enterprise potential"

**Before**: work_mode includes "discover products from repos"
**After**: work_mode is "scale validated products to revenue"

---

## Success Metrics (Revised)

**Not**: Number of repos deployed (vanity metric)
**Not**: Tools built (we have enough)
**Not**: Documentation pages (we have plenty)

**Actually**:
- Mirador customers: Norton + ___ (add 3 more)
- job-search-automation users: ___ paying subscribers
- phishguard-ml pilots: ___ security teams testing
- **Revenue**: $___/month (current: $0, target: $5K+)

**The gap**: $0 → first revenue dollar

**The blockers**: Not tools, not repos, not methodologies

**The blocker**: Asking someone to pay (sales, not building)

---

## The Strategic Focus (Clear and Simple)

**80% effort**: Mirador Systems (Norton success → scale healthcare)
**15% effort**: job-search-automation (real traction → SaaS)
**5% effort**: phishguard-ml (enterprise pilots)

**0% effort**: Building more tools, vetting more repos, deploying demos

**This is the strategy.** Focus on validation, not discovery.
