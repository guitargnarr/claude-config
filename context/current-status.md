## Active Work: Guitar Learning Platform (Days 2-3 Complete)

**Recent Accomplishments (Nov 15-17)**:
- ✅ Workflow optimization complete (pre-commit hooks, E2E path filters, CLAUDE.md reference)
- ✅ Component decomposition (Catalog.jsx: 543→263 lines, 8 modular components)
- ✅ Parallel development proven (8 PRs in 2 days, 100% success rate)
- ✅ Conflict reduction architecture (25% → <5% projected conflict rate)
- ✅ Development velocity: 4x faster than sequential
- ✅ Production deployment: https://guitar.projectlavos.com

**Platform Status**:
- **Live**: guitar.projectlavos.com (React + Vite + Tailwind v3)
- **Components**: 8 modular catalog components + FretVision + TabPlayer + Navigation
- **Features**: Favorites, Progress tracking, Social sharing, Enhanced search, Mobile responsive
- **Architecture**: Clean composition, single responsibility, PropTypes validation
- **Testing**: 328 E2E tests passing, path-filtered CI/CD
- **Content**: 100 Guitar Pro files cataloged (metadata ready, playback pending)

**Today's Philosophy Captured**:
- Building with AI (collaboration, not resistance)
- Substance over validation (educational demonstration, not cash grab)
- Modular craftsmanship (research→plan→build→test→deploy)
- Long-term thinking (patient with process, capability focus)
- **Full philosophy**: @~/.claude/context/working-philosophy.md

**Current Focus**:
- Infrastructure complete (workflow, components, deployment automated)
- **Next logical step**: Guitar Pro file playback integration (alphaTab.js)
- Educational demonstration (showing what AI-enabled solo dev can build)
- Professional quality (suitable for portfolio/interviews)

**Philosophy in Action (Nov 15-17)**:
- Research: Analyzed 8 PRs, identified Catalog.jsx conflict hotspot
- Plan: Designed 8-component modular architecture
- Build: Extracted components with clean boundaries
- Test: Verified builds, functionality, bundle size
- Deploy: Pushed to production, both commits successful

This is how I build: methodical, tested, scalable.

## Parallel Track: Job Search
- 107 applications submitted (10.3% response rate)
- **UofL Department Coordinator III interview: Wed Nov 19, 11am (2 DAYS AWAY)**
- Platform work strengthens SE resume (React, TypeScript, component architecture, testing)
- Guitar platform demonstrates capability for employers
- Strategy: Build to demonstrate, not to seek validation

**Why guitar platform matters for job search**:
Shows I can: architect modular systems, implement parallel development, write testable code, deploy production apps, work with modern stack, collaborate with AI tools effectively.

**What changed from last status (Nov 13)**:
- Shifted focus: Sentinel Platform → Guitar Platform
- Methodology proven: 100% PR success rate, 4x velocity
- Philosophy clarified: Educational demonstration, substance over flash
- Infrastructure complete: Ready for next phase (playback integration)
