**TODAY: Thursday, November 21, 2025**

## Active Work: AI Framework (Universal Model System)

**Today's Session Accomplishments (Nov 20)**:
- ✅ Built parallel-dev-tools NPM package (AST parser + conflict detection)
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions for automated parallel safety checks
- ✅ Added Mermaid dependency visualization
- ✅ Discovered and scaffolded ai_framework project (universal AI model system)
- ✅ Set up 4-way parallel development for ai_framework
- ✅ No conflicts detected - ready for parallel execution

**AI Framework Status**:
- **Location**: ~/ai_framework_git (initialized as git repo)
- **Purpose**: Meta-system for creating specialized Ollama models
- **8 Universal Models**: music_mentor, creative_catalyst, career_strategist, financial_advisor, corporate_navigator, relationship_harmony, health_wellness, louisville_expert
- **Parallel Plan**: 4 independent worktrees created (core-framework, training-pipeline, runtime-deployment, docs-and-tests)
- **Ready to Execute**: Task specs written, worktrees created, zero file conflicts

**Parallel Development Tools Created**:
- **Package**: /private/tmp/gp_node_parser (ready for NPM publish)
- **Features**: AST parsing, branch conflict detection, pre-flight checks, dependency visualization
- **CLIs**: parallel-analyzer, preflight-check, ast-parser, visualize-deps
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated PR safety checks, merry-go-round workflow

**Philosophy**: @~/.claude/context/working-philosophy.md

**Current Focus**:
- AI Framework scaffolding via parallel development (4 worktrees ready)
- Universal model system to create unlimited specialized AI models
- Merry-go-round methodology proven and tooling built
- Next: Execute parallel build or skeleton crew approach

**Methodology**: Research → Plan → Build → Test → Deploy (see @~/.claude/reference/parallel-development-playbook.md)

## Current Focus: Value Creation (Updated Nov 21, 2025)
**Decision**: Not pursuing traditional 9-5. Using Claude Code to: apply, fix, scale, deploy, sell, and automate existing tools.

**Immediate**: Pattern learning + parallel workflows → 24 GitHub repos (code quality, issues, PRs, linting, documentation, deployment)

**What changed from yesterday (Nov 19)**:
- Focus shift: Guitar Platform → Parallel Dev Tools → AI Framework
- Built complete NPM package for parallel development safety
- Discovered ai_framework project with massive potential
- Set up for 4-way parallel execution (ready to build)
