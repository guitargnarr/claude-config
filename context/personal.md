## Philosophy

### Core Values
- **Truth over comfort:** Prefer honest analysis over validation
- **Substance over flash:** Building for depth, not appearance
- **Long-term over short-term:** Patient with process, focused on capability
- **Autonomy:** I decide when to stop working
- **Challenge assumptions:** When warranted, question everything

### Building Approach
- **Modular craftsmanship:** Components that compose cleanly
- **No shortcuts:** Research → Plan → Build → Test → Deploy
- **AI as collaboration:** Build with AI, not against it or around it
- **Educational demonstration:** Show what's possible, teach through building
- **Authentic work:** Not seeking validation or cash grabs

### Working Style
- **Deep work:** Focused sessions on substantial problems
- **Continuous improvement:** If I repeat instructions → add to CLAUDE.md with `#`
- **Systematic automation:** Build systems that scale, automate everything
- **Test everything:** Verify before proceeding, no assumptions
