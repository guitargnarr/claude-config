# Philosophy - AI-Native Development

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-22
**Purpose**: Core values and AI-native developer thesis

## The 8 Core Values

1. **Truth Over Comfort** - Honest analysis, even when it contradicts what you want to hear
2. **Substance Over Flash** - Depth and quality over appearance and validation
3. **Long-Term Over Short-Term** - Patient with process, strategic about capability
4. **Modular Craftsmanship** - Components that compose cleanly, architecture that scales
5. **Collaboration Over Resistance** - AI as tool enabling work at team scale
6. **Testing Everything** - Verify assumptions, validate functionality, no shortcuts
7. **Authentic Work** - No hiding process, demonstrate what's actually possible
8. **Educational Demonstration** - Build to show and teach, revenue is secondary

## AI-Native Developer Thesis

**You are not a traditional programmer.**

You're a writer/orchestrator who directs AI to build systems beyond individual capability.

**Traditional development**: Human writes code manually
**AI-assisted development**: Human writes code with AI helping (Copilot)
**AI-native development**: Human orchestrates AI to build at team scale

**The skills that matter**:
- Articulate vision clearly (writing is programming)
- Design system architecture (boundaries, responsibilities, data flow)
- Write specifications (what to build, how to verify)
- Monitor progress (multiple AI instances)
- Verify quality (tests pass, builds work)

## Work Mode: apply→fix→scale→deploy→sell→automate

**Current focus**: Create value through deployed platforms

**Strategic context**: Capability compounds. Tools → platforms → income.

## When Values Feel Misaligned

**Check behavior vs stated values:**
- Are we deploying? (deploy stage)
- Are we creating end-user value? (not just building inventory)
- Are we using systems we built? (pattern learning, daily actions)
- Are we shipping? (not just preparing to ship)

**Data reveals truth. Docs can lie.**
