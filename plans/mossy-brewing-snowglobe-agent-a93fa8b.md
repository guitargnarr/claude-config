# Texume Document Plan: RMM 2026 Landscape & Positioning

## Document Title & Positioning

**Recommended Title:** "Independent Pharmacy Landscape 2026"

**Subtitle:** "Regulatory Forces | Market Positioning | Strategic Opportunity"

**Prepared For:** Kevin McCarron (for review before Arica)

**Purpose:** A synthesis document that positions RMM's solution within the 2026 regulatory environment and market forces. This is NOT a technical document about what was built (that was the Work Summary). This is a strategic resource that explains WHY RMM matters and WHAT the path forward is.

**What makes this different from existing documents:**
- Work Summary = "Here's what was built"
- Implementation Roadmap = "Here's how to deploy it"
- Individual strategic reports = deep dives on specific topics
- **THIS DOCUMENT** = "Here's the landscape, where RMM fits, and why now"

## Color Scheme Recommendation

**Primary: Teal (existing RMM standard)**

**Rationale:**
- Kevin has already seen teal documents (Work Summary, 8 strategic reports)
- Maintains brand consistency with the "RetailMyMeds look"
- Orange was used for Implementation Roadmap (which Kevin hasn't seen yet)
- Using teal signals this is aligned with the delivered strategic reports

## Complete Section Structure

### 1. Executive Summary (1 page)
**Content:**
- The 2-year reimbursement gap (2026-2028) is the strategic window
- Three compounding forces: CAA 2026 (signed Feb 3), MFP Cycle 1-3, GLP-1 surge
- PBM Reform timeline table (Feb 2026 passage → 2028-2029 implementation)
- RMM's positioning as the operational bridge before reform takes effect
- The scoring/qualification engine as the differentiator

**Key data points:**
- Feb 3, 2026: CAA signed (100% rebate passthrough, PBM delinking)
- 2028-2029: Reform provisions take effect
- 2026-2028: The "gap" where pharmacies need solutions NOW

### 2. The Regulatory Landscape (2-3 pages)

**2.1 CAA 2026 Timeline**
Table showing:
- Event | Date | Impact
- CAA passage | Feb 3, 2026 | Legislative milestone
- Rebate passthrough provision | 2028 | Pharmacies wait 2 years
- PBM delinking provision | 2028-2029 | Pharmacies wait 2-3 years
- Any-willing-pharmacy | 2029 | Pharmacies wait 3 years

**2.2 MFP (Medicare Transaction Facilitator) Analysis**
- Cycle 1 (Jan 2026): 10 drugs, $722.55/transaction shortfall, $10,838/week cash flow gap
- Cycle 2 (Jan 2027): 15 drugs including Ozempic/Wegovy, amplifies GLP-1 pressure
- Cycle 3 (Jan 2028): 15 drugs + first Part B medications
- Compounding effect table showing how exposure grows

**2.3 GLP-1 Economics**
- 95% losing money, $37-42/fill loss
- 394 fills/month average = $14,578-$16,548 monthly loss
- Shortage resolved (Feb 2025), volume surging 700% since 2019
- 86% forced to fill to keep patient relationship

**2.4 DIR Fee Compression**
- 2023: AWP-4-11%
- 2024: AWP-18-26% (post-DIR reform)
- Express Scripts: AWP-26.3%
- The "double whammy" period (2023 retro clawbacks + 2024 point-of-sale)

### 3. RMM Product Architecture (2 pages)

**3.1 The Core Value Proposition**
- $275/month technician-managed routing platform
- Identifies underwater prescriptions at the fill level
- Routes to mail-order while preserving patient relationship
- Dashboard manages multiple patients/prescriptions/refill cycles
- Privacy/independence differentiators (not PBM-affiliated, no PHI retention)

**3.2 ROI Framework**
Three-scenario table (Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive):
- Conservative: 8 GLP-1 fills routed = breakeven + $21/month
- Moderate: 20 fills routed = $465/month net = 169% ROI
- Aggressive: 40 fills routed = $1,405/month net = 511% ROI

**Note:** Keep these numbers generic (don't tie to specific pharmacy names)

**3.3 Differentiators**
- vs PMS systems (bolt-on profit optimization, not full workflow)
- vs Apaly Rx (pharmacy-facing vs employer-facing)
- vs DiversifyRx (eliminate losses vs add revenue streams)
- vs PSAOs (prescription-level vs network-level)

### 4. Qualification Scoring Methodology (2-3 pages)

**4.1 Three-Dimension Model**
- Financial Fit (45%): volume, GLP-1 exposure, gov payer mix, estimated loss
- Operational Readiness (30%): PMS integration priority, staffing, owner engagement
- Market Urgency (25%): MFP exposure, DIR pressure, competitive threats, awareness

**4.2 Grading Scale**
- A (85-100): Strong Fit → Immediate outreach
- B (70-84): Good Fit → Nurture pipeline
- C (55-69): Conditional Fit → Pilot/demo
- D (0-54): Not Recommended → Deprioritize

**4.3 Portfolio Application**
- Batch scoring from CSV input
- Ranked priority list with segment breakdown
- Outreach quadrant matrix (Immediate / Nurture / Conditional / Deprioritize)
- Use case: LA/MS pharmacy portfolio as example (without individual pharmacy names)

**Table:** Sample scoring factors and weights (not actual pharmacy data)

### 5. Competitive Positioning (2-3 pages)

**5.1 Market Categories**
Five competitive categories table:
1. Prescription Routing (Employer/Payer Side) → Apaly Rx, RxBenefits
2. Pharmacy Profitability Coaching & Software → DiversifyRx/UGO, Prescryptive
3. Pharmacy Management Systems → PioneerRx, Liberty, Rx30
4. Wholesale/Network/PSAO → Cardinal Health Outcomes/LeaderNET
5. Emerging Disruptors → Amazon Pharmacy, Cost Plus Drugs

**5.2 RMM's Unique Position**
Positioning matrix showing:
- Buyer (Pharmacy vs Employer)
- Value Prop (Loss Elimination vs Revenue Generation)
- RMM occupies: Pharmacy-facing + Loss Elimination quadrant (alone)

**5.3 Key Differentiators**
- Only platform routing specific underwater Rx while preserving patient relationship
- $275/month accessible pricing (vs $499-$19,999 for PMS, $2,500 for coaching)
- Founded by practicing pharmacist (credibility signal)
- Zero-code webhook integration for Kevin's Wix site

### 6. Go-to-Market Strategy (2-3 pages)

**6.1 State Association Replication**
- WVIPA validation
- Target states by independent pharmacy density (ND, MS, MT highest per capita)
- Convention calendar: NDPhA (April 16-18), MPhA/MIPA (April 8-9, June 4-6), Montana MPA
- Sponsorship model replication playbook

**6.2 Trade Publication Strategy**
Three outlets with specific angles:
- **Drug Store News:** "How Independent Pharmacies Are Surviving the MFP Cash Flow Crisis"
- **Drug Topics:** "The GLP-1 Routing Solution 95% of Pharmacies Need"
- **Pharmacy Times:** "Prescription Economics in the PBM Reform Transition"

Includes editor research and submission-ready pitch templates

**6.3 GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Strategy**
- Why GEO matters: AI search tools cite authoritative structured content
- The 8 strategic reports as GEO assets (if published as HTML on retailmymeds.com)
- Citation-friendly HTML structure (clear headings, FAQ schema, E-E-A-T signals)
- GEO factor table showing opportunity vs current state

**Table:** GEO readiness assessment across content types

### 7. Phase Summary & Recommendations (2 pages)

**7.1 Four-Phase Framework**
Table showing:
- Phase | Status | Key Deliverables | Effort | Monthly Cost
- Foundation | Complete | 16 PDFs, 3 landing pages, API, scoring | 23 AI hrs | $0 (free tier)
- Production | Ready | Zero-code webhook, email, database, auth | 15-22 hrs | $7
- Scale | After Phase 2 | Lead nurture, dashboard, CRM, analytics | 58-83 hrs | ~$7
- SEO-GEO | Phases 2-3 | Content pages, schema markup, state pages | 17-24 hrs | $0

**Note:** Update Phase 2 to reflect zero-code webhook pattern (not async architecture)

**7.2 Immediate Priorities**
1. Kevin builds Wix form + zero-code webhook automation (24-48 hrs)
2. Kevin implements segment landing pages (GLP-1 first)
3. Phase 2 production hardening (always-on hosting, email delivery)
4. Portfolio analysis on real prospect data (Arica provides CSV)

**7.3 Strategic Window**
- The 24-month reimbursement gap (2026-2028) is RMM's opportunity
- Pharmacies need solutions NOW, can't wait for 2028 reform
- After reform, RMM shifts from survival tool to optimization tool
- Execute aggressively in the window

## Template Structure

**File:** `/Users/matthewscott/Projects/texume/templates/landscape_positioning_2026.tex`

**Base Class:** `article` (11pt, letterpaper)

**Template Components Needed:**

### Standard Components (Already Exist)
- `\mychapter{Title}` - chapter-level heading with teal rule
- `\insightbox[LABEL]{content}` - primary teal accent box
- `\questionbox[LABEL]{content}` - secondary orange accent box
- `\metric{text}` - teal bold inline stat
- Cover page with concentric teal rings, title stack, metadata footer

### New Components Needed

**1. Timeline Visualization**
```latex
\newenvironment{timelinebox}{
  % TikZ-based timeline with nodes for milestones
  % Color-coded by urgency/importance
}
```

**2. Positioning Matrix Table**
```latex
% Already have table support via booktabs/tabularx
% Just need structured data formatting
```

**3. ROI Scenario Comparison**
```latex
% Side-by-side comparison boxes (Conservative/Moderate/Aggressive)
% Could use minipage or multicols with insightbox
```

## What Gets STRIPPED from Source Material

### Completely Removed
1. All references to "Matthew Scott" (name, background, Humana history, "rapid prototyper")
2. All references to "Mirador AI framework" (ZIGGY, Reflexia, evolution story, 840 execution chains, persona-based orchestration)
3. All references to "Claude Code" or "AI-assisted development"
4. The 23 hours vs 136 hours development time comparison
5. The Caviar Creative cross-reference (completely irrelevant)
6. Directive language toward Kevin ("Kevin McCarron must implement...")
7. The old "async scorecard architecture" terminology

### Updated/Reframed
1. **Wix Integration:** Now described as "zero-code webhook pattern" where Kevin uses Wix Automations (visual, no-code) to fire webhooks on form submission
2. **Prepared By:** Field left blank or minimal attribution
3. **Technical Infrastructure:** De-emphasized; focus on business value not build process
4. **Prepared For:** "Kevin McCarron" (not "Kevin & Arica" - this is Kevin's review copy first)

## Critical Files for Implementation

When ready to build this document, these 3-5 files are most critical:

1. **/Users/matthewscott/Projects/texume/data/landscape_positioning_2026.py**

## Implementation Notes

**Color Consistency:**
- Primary: Teal (#0F766E) - matches existing RMM documents Kevin has seen
- Secondary: Orange (#F97316) - for questionbox accents
- Background: Slate (#F8FAFC) for insightbox/questionbox fills
- Navy (#0F172A) for text accents

**Sources/Citations:**
- Use `\cit{number}` macro for inline citations
- Sources section at end with numbered list
- All data backed by CMS, NCPA, Three Axis Advisors, industry publications

**Tone:**
- Authoritative but accessible
- Focus on market forces and strategic opportunity
- No technical jargon about development process
- Written for Kevin's review before presenting to Arica

**Key Messaging:**
1. The 24-month reimbursement gap (2026-2028) is the window
2. Three compounding forces create urgency NOW
3. RMM's qualification scoring is the strategic differentiator
4. Competitive landscape validates the approach (others are adjacent, not direct competitors)
5. Go-to-market path is clear (state associations, trade pubs, GEO)

## Validation Checklist Before Generation

- [ ] All Matthew Scott references removed

**FINAL NOTE:** This document is designed to be Kevin's strategic resource - a synthesis that explains the market landscape, RMM's positioning within it, and the path forward. It stands alone from the technical/build documentation and focuses purely on strategic opportunity and go-to-market execution.
